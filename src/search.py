    Monte Carlo Tree Search implementation for AlphaZero algorithm.

    This class implements the MCTS algorithm used in AlphaZero, combining
    neural network evaluation with tree search.

    Attributes:
        game (Environment): Current game state
        child (Dict[Tuple[int, ...], 'MonteCarloTree']): Child nodes
        U (float): Upper Confidence Bound score
        N (int): Visit count
        V (float): Expected value [-1, 1]
        pred_V (Tensor): Neural network value prediction
        prior_prob (Tensor): Prior probability from policy
        outcome (Optional[int]): Game result if terminal
        parent (Optional[MonteCarloTree]): Parent node

    Examples:
        >>> game = Environment()
        >>> mcts = MonteCarloTree(game)
        >>> for _ in range(100):
        >>>     mcts.explore(policy)
        >>> next_state, info = mcts.next(temperature=0.1)

    Notes:
        - UCB formula: V + C * P * sqrt(N_parent) / (1 + N)
        - Values are always from parent player's perspective
